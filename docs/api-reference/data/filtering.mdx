title: 'Filtering by Relations'
description: 'How to filter entities based on related data in many-to-many relationships'
---

You often need to retrieve entries from one entity based on properties of a related entity (for example, get all Teachers who teach "Math"). In bknd, this is handled via the REST API using the `where` clause with dot notation, together with the `join` parameter.

## Understanding `join` vs `with`

Before diving into examples, it's crucial to understand the functional difference between these two parameters:

- **`join`**: Enables filtering by related entity fields using dot notation. This parameter tells the database to join the related table so you can reference its fields in your `where` conditions. The related data is **not** included in the response unless you also use `with`.

- **`with`**: Embeds related entity data in the response. This parameter tells the API to include the full related objects in the returned results. You can use `with` without `join` if you only want to embed data without filtering by it.

**Key Point**: `join` is about **filtering capabilities**, while `with` is about **response structure**.

## Example Use Case

You have:
- An entity: `Teacher`
- Another entity: `Subject`
- Many-to-many relation between them (a Teacher can have many Subjects, and vice versa).

You want to find Teachers that have a Subject with the name 'Math'.

## Examples by Use Case

### 1. Filter by Related Data (join only)

When you want to filter by related entity fields but don't need the related data in the response:

```
GET /api/data/entity/teacher?where={"subject.name":"Math"}&join=subject
```

**Result**: Returns teachers who teach Math, but the response only contains teacher data (no embedded subject information).

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "john@school.edu"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Embed Related Data (with only)

When you want to include related data in the response without filtering by it:

```
GET /api/data/entity/teacher?with=subject
```

**Result**: Returns all teachers with their subjects embedded in the response.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "john@school.edu",
      "subject": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Math",
          "description": "Mathematics course"
        },
        {
          "id": 2,
          "name": "Physics",
          "description": "Physics course"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Filter and Embed (join + with)

When you want both to filter by related data AND include it in the response:

```
GET /api/data/entity/teacher?where={"subject.name":"Math"}&join=subject&with=subject
```

**Result**: Returns teachers who teach Math, with their subject data embedded.

```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Smith",
      "email": "john@school.edu",
      "subject": [
        {
          "id": 1,
          "name": "Math",
          "description": "Mathematics course"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

<Note>
If no operation is provided in the where clause, `$eq` (equals) is assumed by default. So `{"subject.name": "Math"}` is the same as `{"subject.name": {"$eq": "Math"}}`.
</Note>

## POST Endpoint for Complex Queries

For longer or more complex queries, use the POST endpoint. The same `join` and `with` logic applies:

### Filter Only (join without with)
```
POST /api/data/entity/teacher/query
```

Body:
```json
{
  "where": { "subject.name": "Math" },
  "join": ["subject"]
}
```

### Filter and Embed (join with with)
```
POST /api/data/entity/teacher/query
```

Body:
```json
{
  "where": { "subject.name": "Math" },
  "join": ["subject"],
  "with": ["subject"]
}
```

### Complex Multi-Relation Example
```json
{
  "where": { 
    "subject.name": "Math",
    "department.budget": { "$gt": 50000 }
  },
  "join": ["subject", "department"],
  "with": ["subject"],
  "limit": 10,
  "sort": "name"
}
```

This example filters by both subject name and department budget, but only embeds subject data in the response.

## Read Many by Reference

If you have the Subject's ID and want to get all related Teachers quickly:

```
GET /api/data/entity/subject/1/teacher
```

This returns all Teachers related to Subject ID 1. You can still use `with` to embed additional relations:

```
GET /api/data/entity/subject/1/teacher?with=department
```

This returns teachers related to the subject, with their department information embedded.

## When to Use Each Parameter

### Use `join` when:
- You need to filter by related entity fields using dot notation
- You want to reference related data in your `where` conditions
- You don't necessarily need the related data in the response

### Use `with` when:
- You want to include related entity data in the response
- You need to avoid making additional API calls to fetch related data
- You want to reduce the number of requests for better performance

### Use both `join` and `with` when:
- You need to filter by related fields AND want the related data in the response
- You're building a UI that shows both the main entity and its relationships

### Performance Considerations:
- Using `join` without `with` is more efficient if you only need to filter
- Using `with` includes additional data transfer, so only request what you need
- Multiple joins can impact query performance on large datasets

## Example in TypeScript SDK

The TypeScript SDK will automatically choose the right endpoint if your query URL gets too long.

```ts
import { Api } from "bknd/client";

const api = new Api();

// Filter teachers by subject name
const { data: teachers } = await api.data.readMany("teacher", {
   where: {
      "subject.name": "Math"
   },
   join: ["subject"],
   with: {
      subject: {}
   }
});
```

## FAQ

**Q: Are `join` and `with` interchangeable?**

A: No. `join` allows you to use dot notation in filters. `with` specifies embedding related entities in the response. Use both if you want to both filter and receive the related data inline.

**Q: Can I use `with` without `join`?**

A: Yes! If you want to embed related data without filtering by it, you only need `with`. For example: `GET /api/data/entity/teacher?with=subject` returns all teachers with their subjects embedded.

**Q: What happens if I use dot notation in `where` without `join`?**

A: You'll get an error like "Invalid where field: subject.name". The `join` parameter is required to enable dot notation filtering.

**Q: Can I join multiple relations?**

A: Yes! Use arrays: `join=subject,department` or in POST: `"join": ["subject", "department"]`. You can then filter by fields from any joined relation: `where={"subject.name":"Math","department.budget":{"$gt":50000}}`.

**Q: Does `join` affect the response structure?**

A: No. `join` only enables filtering capabilities. It doesn't change what data is returned unless you also use `with`.

## Quick Reference

| Parameter | Purpose | When to Use | Example |
|-----------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `join` | Enables dot notation filtering | Need to filter by related fields | `join=subject` allows `where={"subject.name":"Math"}` |
| `with` | Embeds related data in response | Want related data included | `with=subject` includes subject objects in response |
| `where` | Filters results | Need to limit which records are returned | `where={"name":"John"}` or `where={"subject.name":"Math"}` (with join) |

## Common Patterns

| Use Case | Parameters | Example |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Filter only | `join` + `where` | `?where={"subject.name":"Math"}&join=subject` |
| Embed only | `with` | `?with=subject` |
| Filter + Embed | `join` + `with` + `where` | `?where={"subject.name":"Math"}&join=subject&with=subject` |
| Multiple relations | Arrays of relations | `?join=subject,department&with=subject` |

This guidance will help you construct effective API calls that filter results based on related entity properties. Remember: use `join` for filtering capabilities, `with` for response structure, and both when you need to do both.
