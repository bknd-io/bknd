This backend system focuses on 4 essential building blocks which can be tightly connected:
Data, Auth, Media and Flows.
The main idea is to supply all baseline functionality required in order to accomplish complex
logic and behaviors â€“ instead of hard coding it into the system code. This way, almost any part
of the application is customizable and additionally won't limit you to what it can do.
