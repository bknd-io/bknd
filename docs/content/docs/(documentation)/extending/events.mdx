bknd comes with a powerful built-in event system that allows you to hook into the app lifecycle and extend its functionality. You can hook into these events in two ways:

- `async`: Your listener is not blocking the main execution flow. E.g. on Cloudflare Workers, by default, the `ExecutionContext`'s `waitUntil` method is used so that the listeners runs after the response is sent.
- `sync`: Your listener is blocking the main execution flow. This allows to abort the request in your custom conditions. Some events also allow to return a modified event payload.

  Don't mistake `async` with JavaScript's `async` keyword. The `async` keyword
  is used to indicate that the listener is not blocking the main execution flow.

## Overview

### Listening to events

You can listen to events by using the `EventManager` exposed at `app.emgr`. To register a listener, you can use either of these methods:

- `onEvent`: Register a listener for a specific event with a typed event.
- `on`: Register a listener for an event by its slug.
- `onAny`: Register a listener for all events.

```typescript
import { createApp, AppEvents } from "bknd";
const app = createApp();

app.emgr.onEvent(AppEvents.AppRequest, async (event) => {
  //                                         ^? AppRequest
  console.log("Request received", event.request.url);
});

app.emgr.on("app-request", async (event) => {
  console.log("Request received", event.request.url);
});

app.emgr.onAny(async (event) => {
  console.log("Event received", event.slug);
});
```

You may want to register your listeners inside [`bknd.config.ts`](/extending/config) to make sure they are registered before the app is built:

```typescript title="bknd.config.ts"
import { AppEvents } from "bknd";

export default {
  onBuilt: (app) => {
    app.emgr.onEvent(AppEvents.AppRequest, async (event) => {
      console.log("Request received", event.request.url);
    });
  },
};
```

### Setting a mode

By default, listeners are registered as `async` listeners, meaning that the listener is not blocking the main execution flow. You can change this by passing the mode as the third argument:

```typescript
app.emgr.onEvent(
  AppEvents.AppRequest,
  async (event) => {
    console.log("Request received", event.request.url);
  },
  { mode: "sync" },
);
```

This works for all three methods.

## App Events

These events are emitted by the `App` class and are available on the `AppEvents` object.

```typescript
import { AppEvents } from "bknd";
```

Available events:

{/* <AutoTypeTable path="../app/src/App.ts" name="AppEvents" />  */}
| Event | Params | Description |
|:------|:--------|:------------|
| `AppConfigUpdatedEvent` | `{ app: App }` | Emitted when the app configuration is updated |
| `AppBuiltEvent` | `{ app: App }` | Emitted when the app is built |
| `AppFirstBoot` | `{ app: App }` | Emitted when the app is first booted |
| `AppRequest` | `{ app: App, request: Request }` | Emitted when a request is received |
| `AppBeforeResponse` | `{ app: App, request: Request, response: Response }` | Emitted before a response is sent |

## Database Events

These events are emitted by the `Database` class and are available on the `DatabaseEvents` object. These are divided by events triggered by the `Mutator` and `Repository` classes.

```typescript
import { DatabaseEvents } from "bknd";
```

### Mutator Events

These events are emitted during database mutations (insert, update, delete operations).

| Event                 | Params                                                                                  | Description                                                 |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MutatorInsertBefore` | `{ entity: Entity, data: EntityData }`                                                  | Emitted before inserting a new record. Can modify the data. |
| `MutatorInsertAfter`  | `{ entity: Entity, data: EntityData, changed: EntityData }`                             | Emitted after inserting a new record.                       |
| `MutatorUpdateBefore` | `{ entity: Entity, entityId: PrimaryFieldType, data: EntityData }`                      | Emitted before updating a record. Can modify the data.      |
| `MutatorUpdateAfter`  | `{ entity: Entity, entityId: PrimaryFieldType, data: EntityData, changed: EntityData }` | Emitted after updating a record.                            |
| `MutatorDeleteBefore` | `{ entity: Entity, entityId: PrimaryFieldType }`                                        | Emitted before deleting a record.                           |
| `MutatorDeleteAfter`  | `{ entity: Entity, entityId: PrimaryFieldType, data: EntityData }`                      | Emitted after deleting a record.                            |

### Repository Events

These events are emitted during database queries (find operations).

| Event                      | Params                                                     | Description                              |
| :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `RepositoryFindOneBefore`  | `{ entity: Entity, options: RepoQuery }`                   | Emitted before finding a single record.  |
| `RepositoryFindOneAfter`   | `{ entity: Entity, options: RepoQuery, data: EntityData }` | Emitted after finding a single record.   |
| `RepositoryFindManyBefore` | `{ entity: Entity, options: RepoQuery }`                   | Emitted before finding multiple records. |
| `RepositoryFindManyAfter`  | `{ entity: Entity, options: RepoQuery, data: EntityData }` | Emitted after finding multiple records.  |

## Media Events

These events are emitted by the `Storage` class and are available on the `MediaEvents` object.

```typescript
import { MediaEvents } from "bknd";
```

| Event               | Params                                   | Description                                                              |
| :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `FileUploadedEvent` | `{ file: FileBody } & FileUploadPayload` | Emitted when a file is successfully uploaded. Can modify the event data. |
| `FileDeletedEvent`  | `{ name: string }`                       | Emitted when a file is deleted.                                          |
| `FileAccessEvent`   | `{ name: string }`                       | Emitted when a file is accessed.                                         |
