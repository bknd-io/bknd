Deno is fully supported as a runtime for bknd. If you plan to solely use the API, the setup is pretty straightforward.

```ts title="main.ts"
import { createAdapterApp } from "npm:bknd/adapter";

const app = await createAdapterApp({
   connection: {
      url: "file:data.db",
   },
});

export default {
   fetch: app.fetch,
};
```

## Serve the Admin UI

In order to also serve the static assets of the admin UI, you have 3 choices:

1. Use the `serveStaticViaImport` function to serve the static assets from the `bknd` package directly (requires unstable `raw-imports`).
2. Copy the static assets to your local project and use Hono's `serveStatic` middleware.
3. Use the `adminOptions.assetsPath` property to point to a remote address with the static assets.

### `serveStaticViaImport`

The `serveStaticViaImport` function is a middleware that serves the static assets from the `bknd` package directly using dynamic raw imports. It requires the unstable `raw-imports` feature to be enabled. You can enable it by adding the following to your `deno.json`:

```json title="deno.json"
{
   "unstable": ["raw-imports"]
}
```

Or by using the `--unstable-raw-imports` flag when running your script. Now create a `main.ts` file to serve the API and static assets:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { createRuntimeApp, serveStaticViaImport } from "bknd/adapter";

const app = await createRuntimeApp({
   connection: {
      url: "file:data.db",
   },
   serveStatic: serveStaticViaImport()
});

export default {
   fetch: app.fetch,
};
```

### `serveStatic` from local files

You can also serve the static assets from your local project by using Hono's `serveStatic` middleware. You can do so by copying the static assets to your local project and using the `serveStatic` middleware. First, you have to copy the static assets, by running the following command:

```bash
deno run npm:bknd copy-assets --out public
```

This will copy the static assets to the `public` directory and then serve them from there:

```ts title="main.ts"
import { createRuntimeApp, serveStatic } from "bknd/adapter";
import { serveStatic } from "npm:hono/deno";

const app = await createRuntimeApp({
   connection: {
      url: "file:data.db",
   },
   serveStatic: serveStatic({
      root: "./public",
   }),
});

export default {
   fetch: app.fetch,
};
```

### `adminOptions.assetsPath`

You can also use the `adminOptions.assetsPath` property to point to a remote address with the static assets. This is useful in case none of the other methods work for you.

```ts title="main.ts"
import { createRuntimeApp } from "bknd/adapter";

const app = await createRuntimeApp({
   connection: {
      url: "file:data.db",
   },
   adminOptions: {
      assetsPath: "https://...",
   },
});

export default {
   fetch: app.fetch,
};
```
