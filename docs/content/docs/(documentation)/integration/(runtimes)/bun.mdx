## Installation

To get started with Bun and bknd you can either install the package manually, and follow the descriptions below, or use the CLI starter:

## CLI Starter

Create a new Bun CLI starter project by running the following command:

```sh
npx bknd create -i bun
```

### Manual

Create a new Bun project and then install bknd as a dependency:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={[ 'npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npm install bknd
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install bknd
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add bknd
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add bknd
```

</Tabs>

## Serve the API & static files

The `serve` function of the Bun adapter makes sure to also serve the static files required for
the admin panel.

```tsx title="index.ts"
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/bun";

// if the configuration is omitted, it uses an in-memory database
serve({
  connection: {
    url: "file:data.db",
  },
});
```

For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide.

Run the application using Bun by executing:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
