## Installation

To get started with Node and bknd you can either install the package manually, and follow the descriptions below, or use the CLI starter:

### CLI Starter

Create a new Node CLI starter project by running the following command:

```sh
npx bknd create -i node
```

### Manual

Create a new Node project and then install bknd as a dependency:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={[ 'npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npm install bknd
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install bknd
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add bknd
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add bknd
```

</Tabs>

## Serve the API & static files

The `serve` function of the Node adapter makes sure to also serve the static files required for
the admin panel.

```tsx title="server.ts"
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/node";

// if the configuration is omitted, it uses an in-memory database
/** @type {import("bknd/adapter/node").NodeAdapterOptions} */
const config = {
  connection: {
    url: "file:data.db",
  },
};

serve(config);
```

For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide.

Run the application using node by executing:

```bash
node server.js
```
