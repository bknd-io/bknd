## Installation

To get started with Cloudflare Workers and bknd you can either install the package manually, and follow the descriptions below, or use the CLI starter:

### CLI Starter

Create a new Cloudflare CLI starter project by running the following command:

```sh
npx bknd create -i cloudflare
```

### Manual

Create a new cloudflare worker project by following the [official guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/), and then install bknd as a dependency:

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={[ 'npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>

```bash tab="npm"
npm install bknd
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm install bknd
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn add bknd
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun add bknd
```

</Tabs>

## Serve the API

If you don't choose anything specific, the following code will use the `warm` mode and uses the first D1 binding it finds. See the
chapter [Using a different mode](#using-a-different-mode) for available modes.

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { serve, d1 } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

// scans your environment for the first D1 binding it finds
export default serve();

// manually specifying a D1 binding:
export default serve<Env>({
  app: ({ env }) => d1({ binding: env.D1_BINDING }),
});

// or specify binding using `bindings`
export default serve<Env>({
  bindings: ({ env }) => ({ db: env.D1_BINDING }),
});

// or use LibSQL
export default serve<Env>({
  app: ({ env }) => ({ url: env.DB_URL }),
});
```

For more information about the connection object when using LibSQL, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide.

Now run the worker:

```bash
wrangler dev
```

And confirm it works by opening [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) in
your browser.

## Serve the Admin UI

Now in order to also server the static admin files, you have to modify the `wrangler.toml` to include the static assets. You can do so by either serving the static using the new [Assets feature](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/), or the deprecated [Workers Site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/configuration/).

### Assets

Make sure your assets point to the static assets included in the bknd package:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
assets = { directory = "node_modules/bknd/dist/static" }
```

### Workers Sites

Make sure your site points to the static assets included in the bknd package:

```toml title="wrangler.toml"
[site]
bucket = "node_modules/bknd/dist/static"
```

And then modify the worker entry as follows:

```ts title="src/index.ts"
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";
import manifest from "__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST"; // [!code highlight]

export default serve<Env>({
  app: () => ({
    /* ... */
  }),
  manifest, // [!code highlight]
});
```

## Adding custom routes

You can also add custom routes by defining them after the app has been built, like so:

```ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve<Env>({
  // ...
  onBuilt: async (app) => {
    // [!code highlight]
    app.server.get("/hello", (c) => c.json({ hello: "world" })); // [!code highlight]
  }, // [!code highlight]
});
```

The property `app.server` is a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) instance, you can literally anything you can do with Hono.

## Using a different mode

With the Cloudflare Workers adapter, you're being offered to 4 modes to choose from (default:
`warm`):

| Mode      | Description                                                                                | Use Case                                                                                                                                |
| :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `fresh`   | On every request, the configuration gets refetched, app built and then served.             | Ideal if you don't want to deal with eviction, KV or Durable Objects.                                                                   |
| `warm`    | It tries to keep the built app in memory for as long as possible, and rebuilds if evicted. | Better response times, should be the default choice.                                                                                    |
| `cache`   | The configuration is fetched from KV to reduce the initial roundtrip to the database.      | Generally faster response times with irregular access patterns.                                                                         |
| `durable` | The bknd app is ran inside a Durable Object and can be configured to stay alive.           | Slowest boot time, but fastest responses. Can be kept alive for as long as you want, giving similar response times as server instances. |

### Modes: `fresh` and `warm`

To use either `fresh` or `warm`, all you have to do is adding the desired mode to `cloudflare.
mode`, like so:

```ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve({
  // ...
  mode: "fresh", // mode: "fresh" | "warm" | "cache" | "durable"
});
```

### Mode: `cache`

For the cache mode to work, you also need to specify the KV to be used. For this, use the
`bindings` property:

```ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve<Env>({
  // ...
  mode: "cache",
  bindings: ({ env }) => ({ kv: env.KV }),
});
```

### Mode: `durable` (advanced)

To use the `durable` mode, you have to specify the Durable Object to extract from your
environment, and additionally export the `DurableBkndApp` class:

```ts
import { serve, DurableBkndApp } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export { DurableBkndApp };
export default serve<Env>({
  // ...
  mode: "durable",
  bindings: ({ env }) => ({ dobj: env.DOBJ }),
  keepAliveSeconds: 60, // optional
});
```

Next, you need to define the Durable Object in your `wrangler.toml` file (refer to the [Durable
Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) documentation):

```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DOBJ"
class_name = "DurableBkndApp"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["DurableBkndApp"]
```

Since the communication between the Worker and Durable Object is serialized, the `onBuilt`
property won't work. To use it (e.g. to specify special routes), you need to extend from the
`DurableBkndApp`:

```ts
import type { App } from "bknd";
import { serve, DurableBkndApp } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve({
  // ...
  mode: "durable",
  bindings: ({ env }) => ({ dobj: env.DOBJ }),
  keepAliveSeconds: 60, // optional
});

export class CustomDurableBkndApp extends DurableBkndApp {
  async onBuilt(app: App) {
    app.modules.server.get("/custom/endpoint", (c) => c.text("Custom"));
  }
}
```

In case you've already deployed your Worker, the deploy command may complain about a new class
being used. To fix this issue, you need to add a "rename migration":

```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DOBJ"
class_name = "CustomDurableBkndApp"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["DurableBkndApp"]

[[migrations]]
tag = "v2"
renamed_classes = [{from = "DurableBkndApp", to = "CustomDurableBkndApp"}]
deleted_classes = ["DurableBkndApp"]
```

## D1 Sessions (experimental)

D1 now supports to enable [global read replication](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/best-practices/read-replication/). This allows to reduce latency by reading from the closest region. In order for this to work, D1 has to be started from a bookmark. You can enable this behavior on bknd by setting the `d1.session` property:

```typescript title="src/index.ts"
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve({
  // currently recommended to use "fresh" mode
  // otherwise consecutive requests will use the same bookmark
  mode: "fresh",
  // ...
  d1: {
    // enables D1 sessions
    session: true,
    // (optional) restrict the transport, options: "header" | "cookie"
    // if not specified, it supports both
    transport: "cookie",
    // (optional) choose session constraint if not bookmark present
    // options: "first-primary" | "first-unconstrained"
    first: "first-primary",
  },
});
```

If bknd is used in a stateful user context (like in a browser), it'll automatically send the session cookie to the server to set the correct bookmark. If you need to manually set the bookmark, you can do so by setting the `x-cf-d1-session` header:

```bash
curl -H "x-cf-d1-session: <bookmark>" ...
```
