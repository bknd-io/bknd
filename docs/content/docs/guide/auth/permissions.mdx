<Callout type="warn" title="Set up permissions before enabling the Guard">
  If you enable the Guard without first creating an admin role (with `implicit_allow: true`) and attaching it to a user, you will be locked out of the admin portal. See [Securing Your Admin Portal](/modules/auth#securing-your-admin-portal) for the full checklist.
