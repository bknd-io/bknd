## Installation
To get started with Node and bknd you can either install the package manually, and follow the descriptions below, or use the CLI starter:

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="CLI Starter">
      Create a new Node CLI starter project by running the following command:

      ```sh
      npx bknd create -i node
      ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Manual">
      Create a new Node project and then install bknd as a dependency:

      <InstallBknd />
   </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Serve the API & static files
The `serve` function of the Node adapter makes sure to also serve the static files required for
the admin panel.

``` tsx
// index.js
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/node";

// if the configuration is omitted, it uses an in-memory database
/** @type {import("bknd/adapter/node").NodeAdapterOptions} */
const config = {
   connection: {
      url: "file:data.db"
   }
};

serve(config);
```
For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide.

Run the application using node by executing:
```bash
node index.js
```
