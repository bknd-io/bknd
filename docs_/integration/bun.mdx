      ```sh
      npx bknd create -i bun
      ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Manual">
      Create a new Bun project and then install bknd as a dependency:

   </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Serve the API & static files
The `serve` function of the Bun adapter makes sure to also serve the static files required for
the admin panel.

``` tsx
// index.ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/bun";

// if the configuration is omitted, it uses an in-memory database
serve({
   connection: {
      url: process.env.DB_URL!,
      authToken: process.env.DB_AUTH_TOKEN!
   }
});
```
For more information about the connection object, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide.

Run the application using Bun by executing:
```bash
bun run index.ts
```
