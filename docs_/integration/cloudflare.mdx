import InstallBknd from '/snippets/install-bknd.mdx';

## Installation
To get started with Cloudflare Workers and bknd you can either install the package manually, and follow the descriptions below, or use the CLI starter:

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="CLI Starter">
      Create a new Cloudflare CLI starter project by running the following command:

      ```sh
      npx bknd create -i cloudflare
      ```
   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Manual">
      Create a new cloudflare worker project by following the [official guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/get-started/guide/), and then install bknd as a dependency:

      <InstallBknd />
   </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Serve the API
If you don't choose anything specific, the following code will use the `warm` mode and uses the first D1 binding it finds. See the
chapter [Using a different mode](#using-a-different-mode) for available modes.

```ts src/index.ts
import { serve, d1 } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

// scans your environment for the first D1 binding it finds
export default serve();

// manually specifying a D1 binding:
export default serve<Env>({
  app: ({ env }) => d1({ binding: env.D1_BINDING })
});

// or specify binding using `bindings`
export default serve<Env>({
  bindings: ({ env }) => ({ db: env.D1_BINDING })
});

// or use LibSQL
export default serve<Env>({
  app: ({ env }) => ({ url: env.DB_URL })
});
```

For more information about the connection object when using LibSQL, refer to the [Database](/usage/database) guide.

Now run the worker:
```bash
wrangler dev
```

And confirm it works by opening [http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) in
your browser.

## Serve the Admin UI
Now in order to also server the static admin files, you have to modify the `wrangler.toml` to include the static assets. You can do so by either serving the static using the new [Assets feature](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/), or the deprecated [Workers Site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/sites/configuration/).

<Tabs>
   <Tab title="Assets">
      Make sure your assets point to the static assets included in the bknd package:

      ```toml wrangler.toml
      assets = { directory = "node_modules/bknd/dist/static" }
      ```

   </Tab>
   <Tab title="Workers Sites">
      Make sure your site points to the static assets included in the bknd package:

      ```toml wrangler.toml
      [site]
      bucket = "node_modules/bknd/dist/static"
      ```

      And then modify the worker entry as follows:
      ```ts {2, 6} src/index.ts
      import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";
      import manifest from "__STATIC_CONTENT_MANIFEST";

      export default serve<Env>({
         app: () => ({/* ... */}),
         manifest
      });
      ```
   </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Adding custom routes
You can also add custom routes by defining them after the app has been built, like so:
```ts {5-7}
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve<Env>({
   // ...
   onBuilt: async (app) => {
      app.server.get("/hello", (c) => c.json({ hello: "world" }));
   }
});
```
The property `app.server` is a [Hono](https://hono.dev/) instance, you can literally anything you can do with Hono.

## Using a different mode
With the Cloudflare Workers adapter, you're being offered to 4 modes to choose from (default:
`warm`):

| Mode      | Description                                                                                | Use Case                                                                                                                                |
|:----------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `fresh`   | On every request, the configuration gets refetched, app built and then served.             | Ideal if you don't want to deal with eviction, KV or Durable Objects.                                                                   |
| `warm`    | It tries to keep the built app in memory for as long as possible, and rebuilds if evicted. | Better response times, should be the default choice.                                                                                    |
| `cache`   | The configuration is fetched from KV to reduce the initial roundtrip to the database.      | Generally faster response times with irregular access patterns.                                                                         |
| `durable` | The bknd app is ran inside a Durable Object and can be configured to stay alive.           | Slowest boot time, but fastest responses. Can be kept alive for as long as you want, giving similar response times as server instances. |

### Modes: `fresh` and `warm`
To use either `fresh` or `warm`, all you have to do is adding the desired mode to `cloudflare.
mode`, like so:
```ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve({
   // ...
   mode: "fresh" // mode: "fresh" | "warm" | "cache" | "durable"
});
```

### Mode: `cache`
For the cache mode to work, you also need to specify the KV to be used. For this, use the
`bindings` property:

```ts
import { serve } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve<Env>({
   // ...
   mode: "cache",
   bindings: ({ env }) => ({ kv: env.KV })
});
```

### Mode: `durable` (advanced)
To use the `durable` mode, you have to specify the Durable Object to extract from your
environment, and additionally export the `DurableBkndApp` class:
```ts
import { serve, DurableBkndApp } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export { DurableBkndApp };
export default serve<Env>({
   // ...
   mode: "durable",
   bindings: ({ env }) => ({ dobj: env.DOBJ }),
   keepAliveSeconds: 60 // optional
});
```

Next, you need to define the Durable Object in your `wrangler.toml` file (refer to the [Durable
Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) documentation):
```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DOBJ"
class_name = "DurableBkndApp"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["DurableBkndApp"]
```

Since the communication between the Worker and Durable Object is serialized, the `onBuilt`
property won't work. To use it (e.g. to specify special routes), you need to extend from the
`DurableBkndApp`:
```ts
import type { App } from "bknd";
import { serve, DurableBkndApp } from "bknd/adapter/cloudflare";

export default serve({
   // ...
   mode: "durable",
   bindings: ({ env }) => ({ dobj: env.DOBJ }),
   keepAliveSeconds: 60 // optional
});

export class CustomDurableBkndApp extends DurableBkndApp {
   async onBuilt(app: App) {
      app.modules.server.get("/custom/endpoint", (c) => c.text("Custom"));
   }
}
```
In case you've already deployed your Worker, the deploy command may complain about a new class
being used. To fix this issue, you need to add a "rename migration":
```toml
[[durable_objects.bindings]]
name = "DOBJ"
class_name = "CustomDurableBkndApp"

[[migrations]]
tag = "v1"
new_classes = ["DurableBkndApp"]

[[migrations]]
tag = "v2"
renamed_classes = [{from = "DurableBkndApp", to = "CustomDurableBkndApp"}]
deleted_classes = ["DurableBkndApp"]
```
