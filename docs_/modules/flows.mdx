<Note>
   Flows is the youngest module and its UI is still in development. For the sake of tech preview,
   we decided to exclude it from the Admin UI for now. It will be available very soon.

**bknd** enables you to automate tasks and processes through flexible and powerful workflows.

### **Core Features**  
- **Trigger-Based Executions**:  
  - **Manual**: Trigger workflows manually.  
  - **System Events**: Automate workflows based on system events, such as:  
    - **Data Events**: Entity create, update, or delete.  
    - **Auth Events**: User sign-in, sign-up, sign-out, or deletion.  
    - **Media Events**: File uploads or downloads.  
    - **Server Events**: Before and after request/response handling.  
  - **HTTP Trigger**: Map workflows to any URL path for external triggers.

- **Custom Event Hooks**: Define and trigger custom events within workflows for tailored automation.

- **Task Management**:  
  - Define tasks to run in sequence, parallel, or loops.  
  - Enable conditional task execution based on output results.

- **Execution Modes**:  
  - **Asynchronous**: Run workflows in the background.  
  - **Synchronous**: Block further execution until the workflow completes, similar to traditional code execution.

- **Reusable Components**: Create reusable task sequences (sub-workflows) for better organization and efficiency.

- **OpenAPI Specification (OAS) Tasks**: Upload an OpenAPI spec to execute API requests as part of a workflow.
